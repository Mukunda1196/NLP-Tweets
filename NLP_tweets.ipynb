    "The evaluation metrics show that this model has done a pretty poor job at classifying the sentiments of tweets for self-driving cars.

The confusion matrix also shows that the model correctly guesses tweet sentiments with sentiment of 3 most often.\n",

    "This is most likely due to the fact that there are much more tweets that are labeled with a score of 3 compared to other scores in our training data. To improve, we would need to add more tweet data for the other sentiment scores. Also, it could be useful to use another prediction model, such as deep learning. We could also do further data cleaning to get rid of other unnecessary words. "
